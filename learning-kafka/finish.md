# Congratulations!

You’ve successfully completed the **Kafka Hands-on Training**.

---

### What You’ve Learned
- How to deploy a Kafka broker in KRaft mode using Helm.
- How to set up and use Kafka CLI tools locally.
- Creating, producing to, and consuming from Kafka topics.
- How consumer groups work and how to reset offsets for replaying messages.

### Next Steps
If you’d like to continue learning about Kafka, here are some suggestions:
1. **Explore Kafka Streams**: Learn how to process data streams in real time.
2. **Try Kafka Connect**: Experiment with connectors to integrate Kafka with other systems (databases, file systems, etc.).
3. **Set up a multi-broker cluster**: Scale Kafka by adding more brokers to the cluster.
